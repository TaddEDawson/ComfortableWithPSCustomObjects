    Getting Comfortable with Custom Objects in PowerShell

    Tadd E. Dawson
    Tadd@Microsoft.com

    Questions welcomed and encouraged! Bryan will be moderating.

    Demos and slides will not have anything that is NDA, Microsoft Confidential or proprietary. Comments and Questions may contain information that needs to be treated appropriately.

    Objectives

    PowerShell is powerful in its simplicity and the breadth of what it can be used for. There are many patterns and practices that can be used in implementing PowerShell scripts and the ones that you use will change over time as your knowledge of PowerShell grows. The custom object ([PSCustomObject]) is a great object to learn and leverage that can bring your scripting to the next level.

    Participants completing the hands-on labs/demos will gain skills leveraging PowerShell custom objects to simplify creation of PowerShell script.

    At the end of this session, you should be able to :

    1. Create a custom object in PowerShell.
    2. Update property values and add additional properties.
    3. Use a custom PowerShell Object to combine data from multiple sources to address an example.

#region The BIG 3 - Slide 8
<#
    The Cmdlets Get-Help, Get-Command and Get-Member are what I call the magic or Big 3 to address and answer challenges when working with PowerShell. They are important in helping us understand how to use the various Cmdlets and information that is provided from PowerShell.

    Get-Help
        The `Get-Help` cmdlet displays information about PowerShell concepts and commands, including cmdlets, functions, Common Information Model (CIM) commands, workflows, providers, aliases, and scripts.
    Get-Command
        The `Get-Command` cmdlet gets all commands that are installed on the computer, including cmdlets, aliases, functions, filters, scripts, and applications.
    Get-Member
        The `Get-Member` cmdlet gets the members, the properties and methods, of objects.

Get-Help about_Hash_Tables
<#
    To create a hash table, follow these guidelines:

    -   Begin the hash table with an at sign (@).
    -   Enclose the hash table in braces ({}).
    -   Enter one or more key/value pairs for the content of the hash table.
    -   Use an equal sign (=) to separate each key from its value.
    -   Use a semicolon (;) or a line break to separate the key/value pairs.
    -   Key that contains spaces must be enclosed in quotation marks. Values
        must be valid PowerShell expressions. Strings must appear in quotation
        marks, even if they do not include spaces.
    -   To manage the hash table, save it in a variable.
    -   When assigning an ordered hash table to a variable, place the [ordered]
        attribute before the "@" symbol. If you place it before the variable
        name, the command fails.
